**Dear Brothers and Sisters.** Approaching God is a very serious manner. We should
always strive to approach Him and learn from His teachings. His teachings are everywhere.
If we look at the stars, they tell of His glory. If we look at the ocean, it
tells the depth of His grace. If we look at the mountains, they tell of His
height. Yes, creation speaks and if we take the time to listen and understand, we
too will also learn. 

**Today we heard** of a rich young man approach Jesus and asked Him, “*What good thing
shall I do that I may have eternal life*?” This young man approached Jesus
sincerely asking for advice on how to enter into heaven and spend eternity with
God. He approached Him as a student wanting to get taught. This is how we ought
to approach God. Why? Because we also want to enter heaven and spend eternity
with God being enlightened by His glory, to glory, to glory. If we think about
it, these days are in someway no different than those days. Back in Jesus’s
time the people were talking about this subject and we still do till this very
day, what should I do to inherit eternal life. 

**Everyone wants to be saved** and no follower of Jesus wants to be left behind and face
what he will face, without the help of our Lord and Saviour. There are many
formulas that people have developed to comfort themselves or to make them feel
good about themselves. Some formulize that all I need is faith and I am saved.
As long as I have faith, I will be in heaven when the light fades from my eyes.
Some formulize that, because I deny my body comforts it is pleasing to God and
therefore, He will forgive my sins. While still others believe that they are
predestined to enter heaven. Nothing they can do can add or subtract to this,
your either in or out. If you’re out, I would suggest eating and drinking for
tomorrow you die. Many formulas. 

**The Orthodox Church’s approach** is let us fulfill the commandments that Christ
taught in the Gospels. We have heard one of His teachings today. Christ will
speak to the young man only how the young man can understand, through the
commandments of Moses. “If you want to enter into
life, keep the commandments.”  And
the young, supposing he keeps all the commandments says, “*which ones.”* Jesus
names the commandments. But the young man replies that He keeps them and there
is nothing left for him to do. That, by the way he follows them, they justify
him and perfect his love for God. “*What do I still lack*.” But these did
not perfect or justify him. He was in danger of not entering eternal life
because he had strange gods that were before him. What were these gods? Simply
put it, they were things. Things that the young man acquired and developed an
unhealthy love for them. In other words, he loved them more than God. Jesus
said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell
what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and
come, follow Me.” Let go of your idols that you love more than Me and
when you have done that, follow me. But how hard this is when we begin to love
our possessions. You can just feel it when we read this lesson. Listen to this,
*when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had
great possessions*. He realized that he had a fight on his hands that he was
most likely not going to overcome. He was going to lose and he knew it and
walks away sorrowful. He loved his possessions more than God. 

**What things do we love**? Our house and cars, so that the payment chokes out our
spiritual life, our lifeline to God. Our food, so that even to fast we cannot
bear it. If we love our possessions and what we acquired so much that God comes
second to it, we to will walk away imitating the young man. If we, at the end
of each day, look at our receipts and examine them, we too will know who we
love more, God or things. 

**How hard will it be** for people, who love things so much that God is second, to
enter into heaven. It will be easier for a camel to
go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
To enter the kingdom of God is heaven, and it will be eternal. What shall I do
that I may have eternal life? If only we would ask ourselves this question each
morning we wake up. May we constantly keep this in mind. When the moment
arrives and every word, action and deed and thought will be tested by fire, we
will only at this time understand, what we truly loved. Before this time, we
don’t know.

**Listen to what St John Chrysostom says**, “Nothing can darken and confuse human thought
as a total attachment to the things of the present.” So many people nowadays
tell me that it is so confusing. With no doubts and full confidence, I can say
Chrysostom is right, our thoughts have become darkened and confused because of
our attachment to things. We need things, roof, car, other things, but we begin
to love things that will not love us back. 

**Let us hear** some of the most encouraging words in the Gospel. “With men this is impossible, but with God all things arepossible.” You my brothers and sisters, as long as we depend on
ourselves or our strength or will or desire. We will fail. This is only done
through the grace of God. Not, I believe in God therefore all things are
possible. No. But I will empty myself, and when I am empty I will receive
grace, this grace transfigures me and what used to be impossible is now
possible. With God all things are possible.
