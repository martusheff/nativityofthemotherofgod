  **This Holy Day Palm Sunday** begins with the raising of Lazarus. Christ said
  with a loud


  voice, Lazarus Come forth. This voice was so loud, that it thundered from one side of


  Hades to the other. And this time it was an authoritative voice demanding Lazarus back.


  He was four days dead. Remember the little girl, Jarius daughter? She had just died and


  Christ whispered, “Little girl arise,” and her soul came back. Remember the young man


  that was being carried out, Christ touched the coffin and the young man arose. But now,


  Christ says in a loud and thunderous voice and Lazarus returns to his body. Listen to the


  Glory prayer at Vespers, “Christ is coming to raise your dead by His voice. And when


  bitter and bottomless Hades heard that voice, it shook from fear; it gave forth a great


  groan and released Lazarus, still bound with grave clothes.” The body was smelling and


  decaying, but when the soul returns order is restored. This is no doubt an image of the


  General Resurrection! Christ is victorious. Lazarus who was dead, obeys the voice of


  Christ. Death had him, but could not keep him. Why? Because Christ was simply to


  powerful for death to hold him.




  **After this demonstration**. After this victory, Christ enters Jerusalem. How does He enter?


  Fully arrayed in Golden expensive cloths like a king? Or maybe He was clad in armour


  like a victorious warrior come from battle? No. He enters by fulfilling a prophecy.


  Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your King


  is coming to you; He is just and having salvation, Lowly and riding on a donkey, A colt,


  the foal of a donkey. (Zachariah 9 ; 9.) The people who love God, rejoice for what they


  are witnessing. Christ enters in humility riding on a donkeys offspring. One who rides


  on the wings of the fiery Cherubim, lowers Himself to that of riding an unclean animal.


  Today we are witnessing the condescension of God. God lowering who He actually is, to


  perform a redemptive act, for our sake.




  **Why did He come to Jerusalem?** For what purpose? To render judgment to the one who


  has went against God and tried to taint His creation, the work of His pure hands. To


  render judgment to the ruler of this world. Listen to St John explain this in his Gospel.


  But keep this in mind as Christ is entering Jerusalem. He has already won against death.


  There is nothing more that He needs to do. Remember the little girl Jarius daughter, the


  young man in the coffin and now Lazarus who had been four days dead. The Jews


  believed that the soul hovered around the body for three days, then it went to the other


  place. So four days meant that the soul had left the body. It was in the grip of death. We


  have all heard that term death grip. Where did it come from? From this, that once death


  has a grip on you, no return is possible. He has proven, with out a doubt, that He is


  stronger than death. This is at little vespers, “When Thou didst raise Lazarus, the


  dominion of death was already doomed to destruction.” Once this happened, once they


  heard this loud voice, fear fell upon the demons and they released Lazarus. Once this


  happened they knew they were doomed. The entire realm of Hades realized that they had


  crossed the line and something was going to happen to them and they didn’t know this,


  but Christ was gonna meet them face to face. It didn’t go well for them.


  He says, “Father, save Me from this hour? But for this purpose I came to this hour.


  Father, glorify Your name.” Then a voice came from heaven, saying, “I have both


  glorified it and will glorify it again.” Therefore the people who stood by and heard it


  said that it had thundered. Others said, “An angel has spoken to Him. “Jesus answered


  and said, “This voice did not come because of Me, but for your sake. Now is the


  judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.” This is the purpose


  of His visitation to Earth. This was one of the reasons, But Christ does not stop there.


  “And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all peoples to Myself.” God has willed


  to bring His own creation back to Himself through the Son and His method is the Cross.


  Through this redemptive act we have been given the ability to become sons of light. “A


  little while longer the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness


  overtake you; he who walks in darkness does not know where he is going. While you


  have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light.” When we believe


  in this light, the light touches us, enlightens us, and we are able to follow Christ and


  become sons of Light. The light shows the way because the light is Christ. Do not let the


  darkness overtake you. Follow the light, it is a struggle, but you will know the way.


  During this salvific event we are holding Palm leaves and willow branches. Lucky for us


  Orthodox, every service is like a bible study on steroids and because of this, we


  understand the meaning of holding this in our hands. We are proclaiming the Victory of


  the Resurrection. Each one of us who is holding the palm leaf is making a confession in


  front of everyone in church. We are confessing the truth of the General Resurrection,


  when Christ will come again. Holding the Palm leaf is perfected praise. You don’t even


  have to say anything, just like out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast Thou


  perfected praise. They confessed who Christ was by lining His path into Jerusalem with


  Palm Branches. The Vespers first hymn explains this feast very well, “Today the grace


  of the Holy Spirit hath gathered us together, and we all take up Thy cross and say:


  Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.”

  your heart, and enlighten you so that you become sons of light, as He entered
  Jerusalem.
