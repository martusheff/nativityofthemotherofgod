## The Confused Process

The parishioner says something. The priest can’t make it out, but assumes they want a blessing. He blesses the parishioner and says the words. The parishioner, receiving the blessing, has a deer in the headlights look and forgets how to talk. Confusion ensues while the priest tries to coach the parishioner on what to say and do. This process is repeated again the following Sunday. For many, the tradition of receiving a blessing is neither remembered or understood. I would like to walk you through this difficult process, and with little effort, think you will be able to properly ask for and receive a blessing! But first let us examine who commanded to bless people in the Name of God and how it has progressed.

## First Part of the Blessing

The first part of receiving a blessing is between you and God, through the hand of the priest. Let us listen to how God commanded Moses to tell the priests how to give a blessing. 

> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: “Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, ‘This is the way you shall bless the children of Israel. Say to them:“The Lord bless you and keep you; The Lord make His face shine upon you, And be gracious to you; The Lord lift up His countenance upon you, And give you peace.” “So (in this way) they shall put My name on the children of Israel, and I will bless them.”

Now let us listen to how Jesus Christ blessed the children. Then they brought little children to Him, that He might touch them; but the disciples rebuked those who brought them. But when Jesus saw it, He was greatly displeased and said to them, 

> “Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God. Assuredly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it.” 

## Second Part of the Blessing

The second part of this blessing is between the priest and the receiver. It is like we are sharing and cultivating the same spirit as King David and his beloved friend Jonathan. Two humans that invoke the Lord as a witness to their friendship. Listen to how they would greet each other– One would say to the other, “Indeed the Lord be between you and me forever.”  The reason why their friendship was so strong is because of what their relationship was based on. God at the center of them and in their midst. Jonathan's father, King Saul, wanted to kill David. When Jonathan confronted his father about this, he threw a spear at him and missed.  He would go and tell David that Saul is trying to kill him and that he needed to flee for his life. This would be the final goodbye between two best friends and the last time they would ever see each other face to face again. David arose from a place toward the south, fell on his face to the ground, and bowed down three times. And they kissed one another; and they wept together, but David more so.  Then Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, since we have both sworn in the name of the Lord, saying, ‘May the Lord be between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants, forever.” So he arose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city. This is one of the greatest examples of how to greet and say goodbye to each other. The example of King David and Jonathan, “Christ is in our Midst / He is and forever shall be!”

## How to Receive a Blessing

Come to the priest, speak clearly and with confidence, bow your neck and say, “Father Bless.” Extend your hands with your right hand over the left. The Priest says as he makes the sign of the cross on you, “The blessing of our Lord, God, and Saviour Jesus Christ is upon Thy servant (name), now and ever and unto the ages of ages.” The receiver replies, “Amen,” then kisses the hand. The Priest then says, “Christ is in our Midst.” The receiver replies, “He is and forever shall be.”  I understand that this still might be confusing,  but let us simplify it this way. 

## In English

**Receiver**: “Vladika/Father Bless.”

**Bishop/Priest**: “The blessing of our Lord, God, and Saviour Jesus Christ, is upon Thy servant (name), now and ever and unto the ages of ages.” 

**Receiver**: “Amen.” 

**Bishop/Priest**: “Christ is in our Midst.”

**Receiver**: “He is and forever shall be.”  

## По Русски

**Приемник**» Благослови Владыка/Отче.

**Епископ**» Благословение Господа, Бога, и Спаса Нашего Исуса Христа, подается рабу божию (имя), всегда, и ныне и присно, и во веки веком.

**Приемник**» Аминь.

**Епископ**» Христос посреди нас.

**Приемник**» И есть и будет.

## Questions & Answers

**Do I make the sign of the Cross and then extend my hands?**

No, the Priest is making the sign of the Cross on you. You will not be blessing yourself. You are asking the Priest to bless you. 

**Do I bow down to the floor or touch my hand to the floor?**

No, simply ask by saying, “Father Bless,” bend your neck and extend your hands, right hand over the left.

**What if I say or do something incorrectly? Like I accidentally say, “Always will be” instead of “Forever shall be”. Or if I forget to say, “Amen.” Does the blessing still count?**

We must strive to do all things with a pure and contrite heart. “A heart that is broken and humbled God will not despise.” The only thing that will hinder this blessing is willful ignorance.
